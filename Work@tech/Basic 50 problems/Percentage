// Please make sure not to delete the WorkAtTech class
// You can create additional non-public classes as well
// But the main method should be in the WorkAtTech class
class WorkAtTech
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner input  = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int n = input.nextInt();
		float sum_marks = 0;
		float total_marks=n*80;
		for(int i =0; i<n ;i++){
			float mark =input.nextInt();
			
			sum_marks= sum_marks+ mark;
				
		}
		 float percentage =(sum_marks/total_marks)*100;
		System.out.format("%.2f%%",percentage);
	}
}
-------------------------------------------------
*System.out.format("%.2f%%", percentage);
 means:
1. System.out.format(...): This is used to print formatted output to the console (similar to printf in C).

2. "%.2f%%" is the format string:
    %.2f means a floating-point number with 2 digits after the decimal point.
    %% is used to print a literal percent sign % (since % is a special character in format strings).
3. percentage is the value to be formatted and printed.

Example:
If percentage = 85.6789, the output would be: 85.68%
